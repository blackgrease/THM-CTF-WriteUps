# The WriteUps Repository
In a wrap: Some writeups for THM and Retired Rooms in HTB

Finally after years of procastination and daydreaming, the journey in the Offensive Security world is in full throttle. This is my way of giving back to the community and I have no idea who this may benefit but I hope it touches someone. 

These writeups are made to reflect some flags realisitcally used in penetration tests to the best of my knwoledge while providing some background information concerning technologies, exploits, steps which I felt where missing in other writeups. The writeups are designed as nudges in the right direction and to help whoever is reading get out of the playful mode that some CTFs can bring (which is okay ).I hope you learn something new and help me learn even more.

# The WriteUps Repository
In a wrap: Some writeups for THM and Retired Rooms in HTB

Finally after years of procastination and daydreaming, the journey in the Offensive Security world is in full throttle. This is my way of giving back to te community and I have no idea who this may benefit but I hope it touches someone. 

These writeups are made to reflect realistic penetration tests. They may involve scans that run annonmymously and hide an attacker while performing a penetration test. For example using proxychains while running a Ffuf scan. The writeups are designed as nudges in the wright direction and to help whoever is reading them get out of the playfull moode that some CTFs can bring. Not all writeups will be this extensive otherwise an Easy room would take days to complete. Though I hope hope you learn something new and or help me learn even more.
